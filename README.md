# Numbers new Yii2 projects
This repository contains new implementation of [Numbers](https://github.com/der-fanatiker/numbers-first-project)
project.
I'm going to use Yii2 framework for building it.   

## How-to run this project
You should run it with docker - my favorite tool for building services.
* Clone this repository
* Change directory to docker-numbers-new
* Run **docker-compose build** 
* Run **docker-compose up** or **docker-compose up -d**
* Open [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) in your browser.
